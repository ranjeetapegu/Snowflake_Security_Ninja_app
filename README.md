# Snowflake_Security_Ninja_app

This app is based on the project (Snow Sentry)[https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/security_dashboards_for_snowflake/index.html#0] which was developed to help the customer to know how secure is their snowflake account.
Snowflake customer who wants to gain a deeper understanding of their Snowflake account. 
The app covers :- 
 
 1. Authentication patterns: Failed login attempts organized by user and reason, and account-wide visibility of the authentication types in use
 2. Roles: RBAC maturity ratings, AccountAdmin usage monitoring, least-used roles for users
 3. Users: Most dangerous user, disabled users not yet dropped, and users with stale passwords
 4. Configuration drift: Deviations from baseline normal to network policies, security integrations, replication, and failback-enabled Snowflake Accounts
